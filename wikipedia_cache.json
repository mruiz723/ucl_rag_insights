It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.\nIntroduced in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup (French: Coupe des Clubs Champions Europ\u00e9ens), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997\u201398 season.

The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.\nThe Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs. In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.

These founders saw the new club as a youth branch of their childhood team, Athletic Bilbao who they had just seen win the 1903 Copa del Rey Final in the city. In 1904, they were joined by dissident members of Real Madrid. They began playing in blue and white halved shirts, the then colours of Athletic Bilbao, but by 1910, both the Bilbao and Madrid teams were playing in their current colours of red and white stripes. Some believe the change came about because red and white striped tops were the cheapest to make, as the same combination was used to make ticking for mattresses, and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts. This contributed to the club's nickname, Los Colchoneros.\nHowever, another explanation is that both Athletic Bilbao and Athletic Madrid used to buy Blackburn Rovers' blue and white kits in England. In late 1909, Juan Elorduy, a former player and member of the board of Athletic Madrid, went to England to buy kits for both teams but failed to find Blackburn kits to purchase; he instead bought the red and white shirts of Southampton (the club from the port city which was his embarkation point back to Spain). (Official position of both Southampton FC and Athletic Club). Athletic Madrid adopted the red and white shirt, leading to them being known as Los Rojiblancos, but opted to keep their existing blue shorts whereas the Bilbao team switched to new black shorts. Athletic Bilbao won the 1911 Copa del Rey Final using several 'borrowed' players from Athletic Madrid, including Manol\u00f3n who scored one of their goals.\nAthletic's first ground, the Ronda de Vallecas, was in the eponymous working-class area on the south side of the city. In 1919, the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Urbanizadora Metropolitana\u2014the company that ran the underground communication system in Madrid\u2014acquired some land, near the Ciudad Universitaria. In 1921, Athletic Madrid became independent of parent-club Athletic Bilbao and moved into a 35,800-seater stadium built by the company, the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid.\nDuring the 1920s, Athletic won the Campeonato del Centro three times and were Copa del Rey runners-up in 1921, where they faced parent club Athletic Bilbao, as they would again in 1926. Based on these successes, in 1928 they were invited to join the Primera Divisi\u00f3n of the inaugural La Liga played the following year. During their debut La Liga c",

However, traveling across the country caused financial hardships for some clubs. Real Valladolid (in 1993), and Las Palmas and Espanyol (in 1994) dropped out of the league. Real Madrid withdrew from the league in 1994 when their second reserve team Real Madrid C kept their status in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. 15 teams played in 1994\u201395 and the league was disbanded after the season.

He won both the 1991\u201392 UEFA Cup and 1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League while at Ajax, in addition to five Eredivisie titles and two KNVB Cups. However, after signing a six-year contract extension with Ajax for the 1998\u201399 season, he and his twin brother Ronald took successful legal action to have it voided. Ajax had a verbal agreement that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by, he would be released provided the other stayed. Ajax, however, apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the Champions League.\n\n\n=== Barcelona ===\nIn January 1999, Frank and Ronald de Boer signed for Spanish La Liga club Barcelona for \u00a322 million, joining their former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal at the Camp Nou. After winning the 1998\u201399 La Liga title, they were unable to repeat their earlier triumphs. In 2000, Van Gaal was sacked by Barcelona and Frank suffered the ignominy of testing positive for the banned substance nandrolone a year later. He was suspended but he was reinstated after a successful appeal.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nDe Boer briefly moved to Galatasaray in the summer of 2003 before joining his brother at Rangers in January 2004. He made his Rangers debut in a 1\u20130 win away at Partick Thistle, but in his second appearance for the club he missed the decisive penalty in the shootout as Rangers lost to Hibernian in the Scottish League Cup semi-final. He made a total of 17 appearances for Rangers, scoring two goals against Aberdeen and Dundee. The De Boer brothers left Rangers after UEFA Euro 2004 to play the rest of their football careers in Qatar with Al-Rayyan. De Boer announced his retirement from football in April 2006.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHaving represented his national team 112 times, he was the most capped player in the history of the Netherlands national team, until Edwin van der Sar surpassed him. De Boer made his debut for the Netherlands in September 1990 against Italy.\nDe Boer",

Lionel Messi is the competition's all-time top scorer and the most successful player, with eight titles.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe current competition has existed since 1982. Between 1940 and 1953, several other tournaments between the Spanish league champions and the cup winners (then Copa del General\u00edsimo) were played.\nIn September 1940, a match with this format had the name of Copa de Campeones. It was not repeated until December 1945 when, due to the good relations with the Spanish military government the ambassador of Argentina, offered a trophy called Copa de Oro Argentina. Both these trophies were unofficial and were only played once.\nIn 1941 the Copa Presidente FEF was established as an official tournament founded and organized by the RFEF; however, it was also only contested once, and though 11 of the 12 matches in its mini-league format were played between April and May 1941, its last, decisive fixture was delayed until eventually taking place in September 1947.\nAlso in 1947, the Copa Eva Duarte was established as an annual and official tournament founded and organized by the RFEF, as a tribute to Argentine president Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n and his wife Mar\u00eda Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n. It was played between September and December, usually as one-match finals. The trophy was the predecessor of the current Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, first held in 1982.\nIn 2018, the Supercopa was played for the first time as a single match hosted at a neutral venue in Tangier, Morocco.\nOn 12 November 2019, it was announced that the Supercopa would expand to four teams, the winners and runners-up of the Copa del Rey and La Liga, and would be held at King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for the next three years, in a deal valued at \u20ac120 million. The event was also moved to January in order to reduce the \"congestion\" on teams' schedules. The agreement has faced criticism: Jesus Alvarez, head of sport programming for state broadcaster RTVE, stated that it would not bid for the media rights to the Supercopa, in protest of Saudi Arabia's human and women's rights records\u2014especially in women's sports. Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional president Javier Tebas also criticized the decision, citing the human rights violations and the country's \"pirating\" of European football (in reference to pirate broadcaster beoutQ). In the past, Tebas had been a major advocate to hold the competition outside of Spain, and especially the United States, as part of his efforts to expand La Liga globally. RFEF president Luis Rubiales stated that women would be able to attend the matches without restriction, and defended the agreement as the use of football to \"transform society\".\nNeither the Copa del Rey nor La Liga winners reached the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a final in the first three editions of the four-team format. In June 2021, the extension of the agreement with Saudi Arabia for ten years was announced, to continue playing the tournament in the country until at least 2029.\n\n\n== Predecessors of Supercopa ==\n\n\n=== Early tournaments ===\n\n\n=== Copa Eva Duarte ===\n\n* In 1",

As the request was approved, they started to play their first matches there, mostly against teams formed by British immigrants.\nIn 1898, they founded a club, \"Argentinos Excelsior Club\", which lasted three years until in 1901, three new clubs were established \"Sud Am\u00e9rica F\u00fatbol Club de Barracas al Sur\", \"American Club\" and \"Argentinos Unidos\", with Barracas al Sur the most notable of them. Nevertheless, the club was soon disbanded, establishing \"Colorados Unidos\" on 16 March 1902. On 25 March 1903, both clubs met at Mercado de Hacienda with the purpose of merging again.\nThe club took its name from a French auto racing magazine owned by Germ\u00e1n Vidaillac (a founding partner of French ancestry). The suggestion was well received and the name \"Racing Club\" was immediately approved. Racing was the first football team integrally formed by criollo people.\nThe first jersey worn by the emerging club was white, until 25 July 1904, when it was decided a yellow and black vertical striped jersey would be used. Nevertheless, the recently adopted uniform only lasted a week due to its similarity to Uruguayan club CURCC, being replaced by a design proposed by president Luis Carbone. The jersey had four squares, two light blue and two pink. This light blue and pink design would be worn until 1908, once again replaced by a design with three horizontal bars (two blue and one white). Finally, Racing adopted the light blue and white colors in 1910, in commemoration of the May Revolution's 100th anniversary that same year.\n\n\n=== First years in football ===\n\nRacing affiliated to the Argentine Football Association in 1",

Athletic Bilbao is also the most recent winner, having defeated Mallorca in the 2024 final held at the Estadio de La Cartuja.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1902, a competition under the name Copa de la Coronaci\u00f3n was played after Juan de Astorquia, President of Bilbao Football Club, and Carlos Padr\u00f3s, later president of Real Madrid, suggested a football tournament to celebrate the coronation of Spanish King Alfonso XIII. Four other teams joined Madrid FC for the competition: FC Barcelona, Club Espa\u00f1ol de Foot-Ball, New Foot-Ball de Madrid and Club Bizcaya (a team made up of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC), which eventually defeated Barcelona in the final. That cup is on display in the Athletic Bilbao museum and the club includes the victory as the first of its Copa del Rey wins, but the Royal Spanish Football Federation officially does not recognise it as such, only considering it to be the forerunner of the Copa del Rey.\nThe Copa del Rey was effectively Spain's national football championship from 1903 (the first edition won by Athletic Bilbao with Juan de Astorquia as captain and president) until the foundation of the Campeonato de Liga\u2014League Championship (La Liga)\u2014in 1928. It was initially known as the Copa del Ayuntamiento de Madrid (Madrid City Council's Cup). Between 1905 and 1932, it was known as the Copa de Su Majestad El Rey Alfonso XIII (His Majesty King Alfonso XIII's Cup). During the Second Spanish Republic, it was known as the Copa del Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica (President of the Republic Cup) or Copa de Espa\u00f1a (Spanish Cup) and during the years of Francisco Franco's Spanish State, it was known as the Copa de Su Excelencia El General\u00edsimo or Copa del General\u00edsimo (His Excellency, The Supreme General's Cup).\nAthletic Bilbao were declared winners in 1904 after their opponents Espa\u00f1ol de Madrid failed to show up. Between 1903 and 1909 the competition was organized by Madrid FC or by the Madrid Federation. Afterwards, it was taken over by the FECF (Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Clubs de Football), a forerunner of the RFEF. However, in both 1910 and 1913 there was a split among the clubs and two parallel competitions were held, one organized by the FECF and the other by the UECF (Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Club de Football). All these editions are officially recognized by the RFEF. In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, clubs in the Republican area of Spain entered the Copa de la Espa\u00f1a Libre, with Levante FC (forerunner of the present Levante UD) beating their city rivals Valencia 1\u20130 in the final. Although in 2007 the Congress of Deputies urged the Royal Spanish Football Federation to recognise it as a Copa del Rey win for Levante, for several years the governing body of Spanish football made no decision on the matter. On 25 March 2023, the tournament was officially recognized by the RFEF, but not as a Copa del Rey.\nBecause of the dispute regarding the 1902 competition, the statistics regarding the leading winners are also disputed.

As a club who have a small pool of players to choose from due to their Basque-only policy, this focus on home-grown talent is even more vital to Athletic Bilbao.\n\nMost of the senior team players in recent seasons are youth academy graduates: 15 of the squad in 2014 (as per analysis from the CIES Football Observatory). In 2016, Athletic's total of 17 'homegrown players' (as per UEFA guidelines: three years of training between 15 and 21 years old) still at their formative club was the highest across Europe's 'big five' leagues, significantly more than all other elite clubs apart from neighbours Real Sociedad. Including eight former trainees at other eligible clubs, Athletic's total of 25 homegrown players ranked as the fifth-highest across the continent, although only third in Spain behind Real Madrid and FC Barcelona who retained just a few of the many high-level professionals they produced. Moreover, further end-of-year analysis demonstrated that these graduates were not merely backup squad members but integral elements of the team, involved  in 64% of the minutes in the 2016\u201317 La Liga, where they finished 7th.\nThe core of boys from the local Biscay province are first introduced into the Lezama Alev\u00edn teams at around 10 years of age and advance by an age group every season through Infantil, Cadete and Juvenil levels; there are collaboration agreements in place with the small clubs in the province, whose staff collaborate with Athletic scouts to identify any standout talents emerging at each stage. The players who are retained by Athletic after their Juvenil A spell (aged about 18) typically join the club's farm team in Basauri, CD Basconia, playing at the regionalised fourth level of the Spanish adult system. Their squad is normally expanded further with new signings from the wider regions's youth clubs, most notably Danok Bat  and Antiguoko who regularly challenge the professional academy teams for the title in their Divisi\u00f3n de Honor group. A number of senior players have also emerged from the Txantrea club in Pamplona who have a collaborative agreement with Athletic (renewed for four more years in 2017).\n\nThe players usually spend one or two seasons at Basconia, some going out on loan to other local clubs, before the best are promoted to the reserve team Bilbao Athletic and then on to the senior team when considered ready to do so. There are exceptions to this sequence; notably Iker Muniain showed such promise that he was promoted early to Juvenil A as a 15-year-old in 2008, was selected by Bilbao Athletic as soon as he turned 16 in January 2009 and became a senior team regular at the start of the next season.\nThe club received its first large transfer windfall for a player who had graduated from the youth system since the \u20ac12 million deal of summer 2005 which took Asier del Horno to Chelsea in January 2018, when Aymeric Laporte (one of the few French players to have played for the club at any level) m",

In a survey published by the Argentine Football Association in 2016, 6 out of 11 players of the all-time greatest Argentina national team had played for River Plate.\nRiver have a fierce rivalry with Boca Juniors. Matches between them are known as Supercl\u00e1sico, and the rivalry is among the most heated in the sport, due to the fixture's global popularity and both clubs having the most fans in Argentina. Notable players who have played for River include Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno, Adolfo Pedernera, \u00c1ngel Labruna, Amadeo Carrizo, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Omar S\u00edvori, Daniel Passarella, Enzo Francescoli, Hern\u00e1n Crespo, Javier Mascherano and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording with the club's official history, River Plate was founded on 25 May 1901, close to the La Boca neighborhood (later the home of fierce rivals Boca Juniors). They were formed from the merger of two clubs, \"Santa Rosa\" and \"La Rosales\", with Leopoldo Bard elected as the first president. The name River Plate was chosen because of an incident during the construction of Buenos Aires Port: one of the members had seen how the workers of Dique n\u00ba 3 left their duties for a while to play a football match. The boxes they were working with just said \"The River Plate\" (the name the English gave to the R\u00edo de la Plata) and that inscription was taken to name the new club.\nRiver Plate affiliated to the Argentine Football Association in 1905, debuting in the third division against Facultad de Medicina. On 13 December 1908, the team was promoted to first division after beating Racing Club 2\u20131. However, the match was declared null due to River supporters jumping onto the field to celebrate with the players, so a new match had to be played. River again won, this time 7\u20130, to achieve promotion.\nIn 1914 River won its first domestic championship, the Copa de Competencia Jockey Club and its first international title, the Copa de Competencia Chevallier Boutell. The nickname Los Millonarios came after the acquisition of winger Carlos Peucelle in 1931 for $10,000 and Bernab\u00e9 Ferreyra for $35,000 (Large sum of money for the period",

After representing his birth country Argentina at youth level, he chose to play for the Italy national team at senior level.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRetegui was born and raised in Argentina.  His maternal grandfather Angelo Dimarco emigrated to Argentina from Canicatt\u00ec, Sicily. His father's grandparents on one side of the family were also Italian, specifically from Genoa, while the paternal ancestors were originally Basque (the surname Retegui being from Gipuzkoa, Spain).\nHe is the son of former field hockey player Carlos Retegui, who represented Argentina as a player and coach at various Pan American Games and Olympic Games. His sister Micaela is also an Olympian in the sport.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Early career in Argentina ===\nRetegui began his senior career with Boca Juniors, who signed him years prior from River Plate. He was first promoted into the club's first-team by manager Guillermo Barros Schelotto during the 2017\u201318 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n season, appearing as an unused substitute on occasions against Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed and Estudiantes in December 2017. His professional debut arrived on 17 November 2018, with the forward being substituted on for the final moments of a 1\u20130 home win over Patronato.\nJanuary 2019 saw Retegui loaned to Estudiantes for eighteen months. He appeared eight times in 2018\u201319, before scoring five goals in twenty-one appearances in 2019\u201320.\nIn February 2022, Retegui joined Tigre on a loan deal until the end of 2023.\n\n\n=== Genoa ===\nOn 26 July 2023, Retegui joined Serie A club Genoa on a five-year deal, for a reported fee of \u20ac15 million. On 11 August 2023, he scored his first two goals for the club in a Coppa Italia match against Serie B side Modena.\n\n\n=== Atalanta ===\nRetegui moved to fellow Serie A club Atalanta in a deal worth a reported \u20ac28 million on 8 August 2024, following an anterior cruciate ligament injury to Atalanta forward and Italy teammate Gianluca Scamacca. Later that year, on 26 November, he scored his first Champions League goals by netting a brace in a 6\u20131 away victory over Young Boys. He scored four goals in a 5-0 demolition of Hellas Verona on 8 February 2025, in which he became the first player to score a first-half hat-trick for Atalanta in Serie A.\n\n\n== International career ==\nRetegui represented Argentina at U19 and U20 level, including for the latter at the 2018 South American Games.\nBeing eligible to play for Italy through descent, in February 2023 it was reported Retegui was pre-selected by Roberto Mancini to join the Azzurri team for the first UEFA Euro 2024 qualification games. Retegui received his first official call up to the Italy national team on 17 March 2023, and proceeded to score in his international debut on 23 March against England in a Euro 2024 qualifying match lost 2\u20131 in Naples. He would tally again in his subsequent appearance on 26 March, netting the winner in a 2\u20130 win over Malta in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Ta' Qali, to become the first player to score in his first two competitive matches for the national side since Pierino Prati accomplished the feat in 1968.\nOn 21 March 2024, Retegui scored twice in a 2\u20131 victory over Venezuela. He was the first Genoa player to score a brace for Italy since Virgilio Levratto at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In June 2024, Retegui was included by manager Luciano Spalletti in Italy's squad for UEFA Euro 2024. Later that year, on 6 September, he was named player of the match, in which he also provided an assist, in a 3\u20131 away win over France during the UEFA Nations League, helping his country to secure their first win against their opponent in Paris since April 1954.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of match played 12 February 2025\n\n\n=== International ===\nAs of match played 17 November 2024\n\nItaly score listed first, score column indicates score after each Retegui goal\n\n\n== Honou",

They also place great importance in developing local players through their cantera (youth systems), and were among the last major clubs to adopt a commercial sponsor logo on their jerseys (Athletic doing so in 2008 and Barcelona three years later).\nAs the most successful clubs in their native regions (the Basque Country for Athletic and Catalonia for Barcelona) and seen by many of their supporters as the sporting embodiment of the native population, the clubs have important and similar roles in the national football culture, with Athletic's adherence to a unique 'Basque only' player policy and Barcelona's efforts to become the world's best while maintaining and promoting a distinct Catalan identity exemplifying two diverse approaches to being a sporting symbol of their homelands.\nBarcelona in particular have a far more intense rivalry with Real Madrid \u2013 perceived to represent the dominant Castile region and the Spanish royal family \u2013 sometimes known as the Gran Cl\u00e1sico, it has become simply El Cl\u00e1sico; they also contest a local derby in Greater Barcelona against  Espanyol which too has political aspects. Athletic Bilbao's attitude towards Real Madrid is also more frosty than their relationship with Barcelona due to the differences in the political and cultural identity of the clubs, and they have a significant local rivalry in the Basque autonomous region with Real Sociedad.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe date of the first meeting between the two clubs is a matter of debate. The final of the 1902 Copa de la Coronaci\u00f3n was played between Barcelona and Club Biscaya (a combined team of Athletic Club and Bilbao FC, which merged the following year); Biscaya won the match 2\u20131. Athletic regard themselves as the successor to the Biscaya team and the Copa Coronaci\u00f3n as the first edition of the Copa del Rey, including it with later wins in their official honours. However, the Spanish Federation gives 1903 as the commencement date for the Copa del Rey, disregarding the previous year's tournament in its records, so it has never been fully established if they regard Biscaya and Athletic as the same club or not. Barcelona's team in the final also included players from Hispania AC, meaning theirs was also something of a combined force rather than a single club entity.\nAthletic and Barcelona were both successful in the early years of the national cup: between 1903 and 1920, the Basques won seven Copas and the Catalans three (including wins for both in the 1910 edition where two competitions were held, both considered official retrospectively), but they did not face each other at any st",

A total of 16 teams competed in the knockout phase.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\n\n\n== Qualified teams ==\nThe knockout phase involved the 16 teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage.\n\n\n== Format ==\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, then 30 minutes of extra time was played (the away goals rule was not applied). If the score was still level at the end of extra time, the winners were decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if the score was level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score was still level.\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\n\nIn the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight group runners-up were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other.\nIn the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association could be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals were held together before the quarter-finals were played, the identity of the quarter-final winners was not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw was also held to determine which semi-final winner was designated as the \"home\" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it was played at a neutral venue).\nFor the quarter-finals and semi-finals, teams from the same city (e.g. A.C. Milan and Inter Milan, who share the same stadium), were not scheduled to play at home on the same day or consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control. To avoid such scheduling conflict, if the two teams were drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team which was not titleholders of Champions League or Europa League (or lower-tier, if both were continental titleholders), or the team with the lower domestic ranking in the qualifying season (if neither team were continental title holder, e.g. Inter Milan for this season) was reversed from the original draw.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nThe schedule was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== Round of 16 ==\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 7 November 2022, 12:00 CET.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 14, 15, 21 and 22 February, and the second legs were played on 7, 8, 14 and 15 March 2023.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n\nManchester City won 8\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nBenfica won 7\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nReal Madrid won 6\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nMilan won 1\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nNapoli won 5\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nChelsea won 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nInter Milan won 1\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nBayern Munich won 3\u20130 on aggregate.\n\n\n== Quarter-finals ==\nThe draw for the quarter-finals was held on 17 March 2023, 12:00 CET.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 11 and 12 April, and the second legs were played on 18 and 19 April 2023.\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n\nReal Madrid won 4\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nInter Milan won 5\u20133 on aggregate.\n\nManchester City won 4\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nMilan won 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\n\n== Semi-finals ==\nThe draw for the semi-finals was held on 17 March 2023, 12:00 CET, after the quarter-final draw.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 9 and 10 May, and the second legs were played on 16 and 17 M",

He was also aiming to become the first manager to win two European trebles, having done so with Barcelona in 2008\u201309. Additionally, Manchester City were attempting to secure the continental treble, having earlier won the Premier League and FA Cup. After West Ham United's triumph in the 2023 UEFA Europa Conference League final three days earlier, they became the English team with the longest European major trophy drought\u201453 years since their latest triumph. \nOn the other hand, this was Inter Milan's eighth European final and sixth UEFA Champions League final appearance, having won 3\u20131 in 1964 against Real Madrid, 1\u20130 against Benfica at their home ground the San Siro in 1965, and 2\u20130 against Bayern Munich in 2010\u2014resulting in Inter completing the continental treble; they also lost 2\u20131 to Celtic in 1967 and 2\u20130 to Ajax in 1972. Inter was also the most recent Italian club to win the Champions League; since 2010 only one other Italian club\u2014Juventus\u2014had reached the Champions League final, losing in 2015 and 2017. Having won the 2023 Coppa Italia final against Fiorentina, Inter were attempting to win a cup double. Manager Simone Inzaghi was aiming for his first European title as manager and the second in his football career, having won against Manchester United in the 1999 UEFA Super Cup as a Lazio player. Their midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan was aiming to become the 11th player to have won all three major European trophies and the first to have achieved that with three different clubs, having won the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League with Manchester United and the 2021\u201322 UEFA Europa Conference League with Roma.\nThis was the first meeting in UEFA competitions between Manchester City and Inter Milan.

The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles:\n\nPot 1 contained the Europa League title holders, and the champions of the top seven associations based on their 2021\u201322 UEFA country coefficients.\nPot 2, 3 and 4 contained the remaining teams, seeded based on their 2021\u201322 UEFA club coefficients.\nTeams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group. Prior to the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams) based on television audiences, where one team was drawn into Groups A\u2013D and another team was drawn into Groups E\u2013H, so that the two teams would play on different days. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed:\n\nOn each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday. The fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public. Each team would not play more than two home matches or two away matches in a row, and would play one home match and one away match on the first and last matchdays (Regulations Article 16.02). This arrangement was different from previous seasons, where the same two teams would play at home on the first and last matchdays.\n\n\n== Teams ==\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2022 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included:\n\n26 teams which entered in this stage\n6 winners of the play-off round (4 from Champions Path, 2 from League Path)\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Format ==\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The top two teams of each group advanced to the round of 16. The third-placed teams were transferred to the Europa League knockout round play-offs, while the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from European competitions for the season.\n\n\n=== Tiebreakers ===\nTeams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss).

The competition was held from June to September 2022 (league phase), June 2023 (Nations League Finals), and March 2024 (relegation play-outs).\nFollowing their win in 2021, defending champions France were unable to defend their title in the finals after finishing third in their group.\nSpain won the final against Croatia, 5\u20134 on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw after extra time, for their first UEFA Nations League title.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe 55 UEFA national teams were divided into four leagues, with Leagues A, B, and C featuring 16 teams each, divided into four groups of four teams. League D featured seven teams divided into two groups, with one containing four teams and the other containing three. The teams were allocated to leagues based on the 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League overall ranking. Each team played six matches within their group, except for one group in League D which played four, using the home-and-away round-robin format in June (four matchdays) and September 2022 (two matchdays).\nIn the top division, League A, teams competed to become the UEFA Nations League champions. The four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals in June 2023, which was played in a knockout format, consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off, and final. The semi-final pairings were determined using a draw. The host country was selected among the four qualified teams by the UEFA Executive Committee, with the winners of the final crowned as the Nations League champions.\nTeams also competed for promotion and relegation to a higher or lower league. The group winners in Leagues B, C, and D were promoted, while the last-placed teams of each group in Leagues A and B were relegated. As League C had four groups while League D had only two, the League C team that was to be relegated was determined by relegation play-outs in March 2024.\nOriginally, the play-outs would have involved all four of the fourth-placed League C teams, with the two losers being relegated to League D. However, due to the ongoing suspension of Russia from all UEFA competitions, the league allocation for the 2024\u201325 UEFA Nations League was changed so that only one team would be relegated to League D, ensuring that League C would still consist of 16 teams. Based on the Nations League overall ranking of the fourth-placed teams, the two worst-ranked teams qualified for the play-outs.\nThe tie was played over two legs, with the higher-ranked team hosting the second leg. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs remained in League C, while the loser was relegated to League D. If the aggregate score was level, extra time was played without the away goals rule. If the score remained level after extra time, a penalty shoot-out was used to decide the winner.\n\n\n=== Tiebreakers for group ranking ===\nIf two or more teams in the same group were equal on points on completion of the league phase, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:\n\nHigher number of points obtained in the matches played among the teams in question;\nSuperior goal difference in matches played among the teams in question;\nHigher number of goals scored in the matches played among the teams in question;\nIf, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 were reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 11 applied;\nSuperior goal difference in all group matches;\nHigher number of goals scored in all group matches;\nHigher number of away goals scored in all group matches;\nHigher number of wins in all group matches;\nHigher number of away wins in all group matches;\nLower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point",

Additionally, Dortmund played one European Cup Winners' Cup final (winning in 1966) and two UEFA Cup finals (losing in 1993 and 2002).\nReal Madrid played in a record-extending 18th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and their second in three years. They previously won 14 finals (in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022) and lost three (1962, 1964 and 1981). Their manager Carlo Ancelotti reached a record-extending sixth UEFA Champions League final as manager, winning in 2003 and 2007 and losing in 2005 while in charge of Milan, and winning the 2014 and 2022 finals with Real Madrid. Real Madrid also played in two European Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986).\nThis was the first Champions League final between the two clubs, and their first meeting in European competitions since the 2017\u201318 Champions League group stage encounters, when Madrid won 3\u20131 away and 3\u20132 at home. Of their previous fourteen encounters, Dortmund won three matches, Real won six matches and five finished as a draw.\nUntil the semi-finals, Borussia Dortmund had the best defence in the 2023\u201324 Champions League with six clean sheets and eight goals conceded. In contrast, Real Madrid goalkeepers had the most goal-scoring opportunities to prevent in the same season.\n\n\n=== Previous finals ===\nIn the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\n\n\n== Venue ==\nThis was the third UEFA Champions League final to take place at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, having previously been held in 2011 and 2013. Overall, it was the eighth final to be held in London, with the other five matches taking place at the original Wembley Stadium in 1963, 1968, 1971, 1978, and 1992. The match was the ninth European Cup final held in England, with the 2003 final having been held at Old Trafford in Manchester, equalling the record of nine European Cup finals held in each of Italy, Germany and Spain. It was also the thirteenth held in the United Kingdom, with the 1960, 1976 and 2002 finals held in Scotland and the 2017 final held in Wales. Wembley Stadium was also a host venue at UEFA Euro 2020, with eight matches played at the stadium including the semi-finals and final.\n\n\n=== Host selection ===\nAn open bidding process was launched on 22 February 2019 by UEFA to select the 2022 and 2023 UEFA Champions League final venues.

It was the third time the two sides have met in the European Cup final, after 1981 and 2018, the third final held at the Stade de France, after the 2000 and 2006 finals, and the first time the same two teams have met in three finals. Real Madrid won the match 1\u20130 via a 59th-minute goal from Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, assisted by Federico Valverde, for a record-extending 14th title, and their fifth in nine years.\nThis was the first final to be played in front of a full attendance since the 2019 final, as the previous two finals were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The final was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich. After the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the final hosts were shifted back a year, so the 2022 final was given to the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, however, UEFA called an extraordinary meeting of the executive committee a day later, and the final was relocated to the Stade de France. Before the match, chaos descended following issues with crowd control, which led to kickoff being delayed by 36 minutes.\nAs winners, Real Madrid earned the right to play against the winners of the 2021\u201322 UEFA Europa League,  Eintracht Frankfurt, in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup, in which they both won. The team also qualified for the 2025 expanded FIFA Club World Cup using UEFA's champions pathway (The winners of the 2021\u20132024 Champions Leagues), with Liverpool increasing their chances of qualifying using the UEFA coefficient pathway (The top 8 clubs qualifying).\n\n\n== Background ==\nLiverpool played in their 10th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. They had previously won six finals (in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019) and lost three (in 1985, 2007 and 2018). This was the fourth UEFA Champions League final for manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, after his loss with Borussia Dortmund in 2013 and the Liverpool finals in 2018 and 2019 the latter of which he won. In addition to their six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, Liverpool also played in one European Cup Winners' Cup final, losing in 1966 against Borussia Dortmund, and in four UEFA Cup/Europa League finals, winning in 1973, 1976 and 2001 and losing in 2016. Their manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp was seeking to become the fourth consecutive German to manage a Champions League-winning club.\nReal Madrid played in a record 17th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and the first since their win in 2018 against Liverpool. They previously won 13 finals (in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018) and lost three (1962, 1964 and 1981). Their manager Carlo Ancelotti reached a record fifth UEFA Champions League final as manager, winning in 2003 and 2007 and losing in 2005 while in charge of Milan, and winning the 2014 final with Real Madrid, and was seeking to become the first manager in history to win four UEFA Champions League titles and eight European trophies. Real Madrid also played in two European Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986).\nThis was a record-third time that the two teams meet in the final, after the 1981 final, which was held in the Parc des Princes in Paris and in which Liverpool prevailed 1\u20130, and the 2018 final held at the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex in Kyiv, which was won 3\u20131 by Real Madrid. This was also the third final for Carlo Ancelotti as manager against Liverpool, after the 2005 and 2007 finals",

Should any teams have been equal on points and tied on the first five criteria, they were considered equal in position and sorted alphabetically. Criteria 6 to 10 was only used to break ties upon completion of all matches.\n\n\n== Teams and seeding ==\nThe 36 teams were divided into four pots of nine teams each, with the Champions League title holders automatically placed as the top seed of pot 1. All remaining teams were allocated to pots based on their 2024 UEFA club coefficients. The participants included:\n\n29 teams which entered at this stage\n7 winners of the play-off round (5 from the Champions Path, 2 from the League Path)\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Draw ==\nThe draw for the league phase pairings was held at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 29 August 2024, 18:00 CEST. All 36 teams were manually drawn using physical balls. For every team manually drawn, a guest on stage pressed the button for the automated software to digitally draw their opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones away. Each team faced two opponents from each of the four pots, one of which they faced at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association. The draw started with Pot 1, assigning opponents to all teams, one after the other, and continued with the other pots in ascending order until all teams were assigned their opponents.\nThe switch to a primarily computer-based draw was made due to issues with the complexity and duration required by a manual draw.

It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.\nIntroduced in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup (French: Coupe des Clubs Champions Europ\u00e9ens), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997\u201398 season. While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default, with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season. Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.\nIn its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June. The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.\nSpanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins), Italy (12 wins), Germany (8 wins), Netherlands (6 wins) and Portugal (4 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once. Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions). Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019\u201320 season. Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2\u20130 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title.",

The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.\nThe Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs. In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.

A total of 16 teams competed in the knockout phase.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\n\n\n== Qualified teams ==\nThe knockout phase involved the 16 teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage.\n\n\n== Format ==\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, then 30 minutes of extra time was played (the away goals rule was not applied). If the score was still level at the end of extra time, the winners were decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if the score was level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score was still level.\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\n\nIn the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight group runners-up were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nIn the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, there were no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association could be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals were held together before the quarter-finals were played, the identity of the quarter-final winners was not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw was also held to determine which semi-final winner was designated as the \"home\" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it was played at a neutral venue).\nFor the quarter-finals and semi-finals, teams from the same city, were not scheduled to play at home on the same day or consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control. To avoid such scheduling conflict, if the two teams were drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team which was not titleholders of Champions League or Europa League (or lower-tier, if both were continental titleholders), or the team with the lower domestic ranking in the qualifying season (if neither team were continental title holder) was reversed from the original draw.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nThe schedule was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== Round of 16 ==\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 18 December 2023, 12:00 CET.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 13, 14, 20 and 21 February, and the second legs were played on 5, 6, 12 and 13 March 2024.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n\n1\u20131 on aggregate; Arsenal won 4\u20132 on penalties.\n\nBarcelona won 4\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nParis Saint-Germain won 4\u20131 on aggregate.\n\n2\u20132 on aggregate; Atl\u00e9tico Madrid won 3\u20132 on penalties.\n\nBorussia Dortmund won 3\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nBayern Munich won 3\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nManchester City won 6\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nReal Madrid won 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\n\n== Quarter-finals ==\nThe draw for the quarter-finals was held on 15 March 2024, 12:00 CET.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 9 and 10 April, and the second legs were played on 16 and 17 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n\nBayern Munich won 3\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nBorussia Dortmund won 5\u20134 on aggregate.\n\n4\u20134 on aggregate; Real Madrid won 4\u20133 on penalties.\n\nParis Saint-Germain won 6\u20134 on aggregate.\n\n\n== Semi-finals ==\nThe draw for the semi-finals was held on 15 March 2024, 12:00 CET, after the quarter-final draw.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 30 April and 1 May, and the second legs were played on 7 and 8 ",

Additionally, Dortmund played one European Cup Winners' Cup final (winning in 1966) and two UEFA Cup finals (losing in 1993 and 2002).\nReal Madrid played in a record-extending 18th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and their second in three years. They previously won 14 finals (in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022) and lost three (1962, 1964 and 1981). Their manager Carlo Ancelotti reached a record-extending sixth UEFA Champions League final as manager, winning in 2003 and 2007 and losing in 2005 while in charge of Milan, and winning the 2014 and 2022 finals with Real Madrid. Real Madrid also played in two European Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986).\nThis was the first Champions League final between the two clubs, and their first meeting in European competitions since the 2017\u201318 Champions League group stage encounters, when Madrid won 3\u20131 away and 3\u20132 at home. Of their previous fourteen encounters, Dortmund won three matches, Real won six matches and five finished as a draw.\nUntil the semi-finals, Borussia Dortmund had the best defence in the 2023\u201324 Champions League with six clean sheets and eight goals conceded. In contrast, Real Madrid goalkeepers had the most goal-scoring opportunities to prevent in the same season.\n\n\n=== Previous finals ===\nIn the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\n\n\n== Venue ==\nThis was the third UEFA Champions League final to take place at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, having previously been held in 2011 and 2013. Overall, it was the eighth final to be held in London, with the other five matches taking place at the original Wembley Stadium in 1963, 1968, 1971, 1978, and 1992. The match was the ninth European Cup final held in England, with the 2003 final having been held at Old Trafford in Manchester, equalling the record of nine European Cup finals held in each of Italy, Germany and Spain. It was also the thirteenth held in the United Kingdom, with the 1960, 1976 and 2002 finals held in Scotland and the 2017 final held in Wales. Wembley Stadium was also a host venue at UEFA Euro 2020, with eight matches played at the stadium including the semi-finals and final.\n\n\n=== Host selection ===\nAn open bidding process was launched on 22 February 2019 by UEFA to select the 2022 and 2023 UEFA Champions League final venues.

The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles:\n\nPot 1 contained the Europa League title holders, and the champions of the top seven associations based on their 2022\u201323 UEFA country coefficients.\nPot 2, 3 and 4 contained the remaining teams, seeded based on their 2022\u201323 UEFA club coefficients.\nTeams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group. Prior to the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams) based on television audiences, where one team would be drawn into Groups A\u2013D and another team would be drawn into Groups E\u2013H, so that the two teams would play on different days. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed:\n\nOn each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday. The fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public. Each team did not play more than two home matches or two away matches in a row, and played one home match and one away match on the first and last matchdays (Regulations Article 16.02).\n\n\n== Teams ==\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2023 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included:\n\n26 teams which entered in this stage\n6 winners of the play-off round (4 from Champions Path, 2 from League Path)\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Format ==\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The top two teams of each group advanced to the round of 16. The third-placed teams were transferred to the Europa League knockout round play-offs, while the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from European competitions for the season.\n\n\n=== Tiebreakers ===\nTeams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams were tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (see Article 17 Equality of points \u2013 group stage, Regulations of the UEFA Champions League):\n\nPoints in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;\nGoal difference in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;\nGoals scored in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;\nIf more than two teams were tied, and after applying all head-to-head criteria above, a subset of teams were still tied, all head-to-head criteria above were reapplied exclusively to this subset of teams;\nGoal difference in all group matches;\nGoals scored in all group matches;\nAway goals scored in all group matches;\nWins in all group matches;\nAway wins in all group matches;\nDisciplinary points (direct red card = 3 points; double yellow card = 3 points; single yellow card = 1 point);\nUEFA club coefficient.\n\n\n== Groups ==\nThe fixtures were announced on 2 September 2023, two days after the draw.

Manager Pep Guardiola was looking to win his third UEFA Champions League title and the first since 2011 with former employers Barcelona, when they beat Manchester United 3\u20131 at Wembley Stadium. He was also aiming to become the first manager to win two European trebles, having done so with Barcelona in 2008\u201309. Additionally, Manchester City were attempting to secure the continental treble, having earlier won the Premier League and FA Cup. After West Ham United's triumph in the 2023 UEFA Europa Conference League final three days earlier, they became the English team with the longest European major trophy drought\u201453 years since their latest triumph. \nOn the other hand, this was Inter Milan's eighth European final and sixth UEFA Champions League final appearance, having won 3\u20131 in 1964 against Real Madrid, 1\u20130 against Benfica at their home ground the San Siro in 1965, and 2\u20130 against Bayern Munich in 2010\u2014resulting in Inter completing the continental treble; they also lost 2\u20131 to Celtic in 1967 and 2\u20130 to Ajax in 1972. Inter was also the most recent Italian club to win the Champions League; since 2010 only one other Italian club\u2014Juventus\u2014had reached the Champions League final, losing in 2015 and 2017. Having won the 2023 Coppa Italia final against Fiorentina, Inter were attempting to win a cup double. Manager Simone Inzaghi was aiming for his first European title as manager and the second in his football career, having won against Manchester United in the 1999 UEFA Super Cup as a Lazio player. Their midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan was aiming to become the 11th player to have won all three major European trophies and the first to have achieved that with three different clubs, having won the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League with Manchester United and the 2021\u201322 UEFA Europa Conference League with Roma.\nThis was the first meeting in UEFA competitions between Manchester City and Inter Milan. Manchester City had won six matches against Italian clubs, while Inter had won 16 matches against English clubs.\n\n\n=== Previous finals ===\nIn the following table, finals",

A total of 24 teams competed in the knockout phase.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\n\n\n== Qualified teams ==\nThe knockout phase involved 24 teams: the 16 teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage, and the eight third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage.\n\n\n=== Europa League group stage winners and runners-up ===\n\n\n=== Champions League group stage third-placed teams ===\n\n\n== Format ==\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, then 30 minutes of extra time was played (the away goals rule was not applied). If the score was still level at the end of extra time, the winners were decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if the score was level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score was still level.\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\n\nIn the draw for the knockout round play-offs, the eight group runners-up were seeded, and the eight Champions League group third-placed teams were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nIn the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight winners of the knockout round play-offs were unseeded. Again, the seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nIn the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same association could be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals were held together before the quarter-finals were played, the identity of the quarter-final winners was not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw was also held to determine which semi-final winner would be designated as the \"home\" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it was played at a neutral venue).\nIn the knockout phase, teams from the same or nearby cities (Benfica and Sporting CP) were not scheduled to play at home on the same day, due to logistics and crowd control. To avoid such scheduling conflicts, adjustments had to be made by UEFA. For the knockout round play-offs and a round of 16, if the two teams are in the same seeding pot and must play at home for the same leg, the home match of the team that was not domestic cup champions in the qualifying season, or the team with the lower domestic ranking (if neither team were the domestic cup champions, i.e. Sporting CP for this season), was moved from Thursday to Wednesday. For the quarter-finals and semi-finals, if the two teams were drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team with the lowest priority would be reversed from the original draw.\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== Knockout round play-offs ==\nThe draw for the knockout round play-offs was held on 18 December 2023, 13:00 CET.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 15 February, and the second legs were played on 22 February 2024.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n\n2\u20132 on aggregate; Roma won 4\u20132 on penalties.\n\nMilan won 5\u20133 on aggregate.\n\nSC Freiburg won 3\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nSporting CP won 4\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nBenfica won 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nQaraba\u011f won 6\u20135 on aggregate.\n\nSparta Prague won 6\u20134 on aggregate.\n\nMarseille won 5\u20133 on aggregate.\n",

However, weeks prior to the final, the 2021 fixture was moved to Porto due to travel restrictions.\nMunich, originally selected to host the 2022 final by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 24 September 2019, was later planned to host the 2023 final after the shifting of the final hosts.

Their manager Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendilibar was seeking the first major title in his managerial career.\nRoma were into their fourth European final and seeking their first UEFA Cup/Europa League title, having lost the 1984 European Cup final and the 1991 UEFA Cup final as well as winning the 2021\u201322 UEFA Europa Conference League. Manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was also looking to win his second consecutive European title with Roma. He could become the first manager since Rafael Ben\u00edtez in 2005 to win two different major European trophies in consecutive seasons, and the first of the five managers to achieve that twice, having done so with Porto in 2004. He also had the chance to become the first manager to win six major European competition titles and also the first to have won the UEFA Cup/Europa League with three distinct clubs, having won the 2002\u201303 UEFA Cup with Porto and the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League with Manchester United.\nBoth clubs had met in the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League knockout phase round of 16, which was only occurred in a single tie because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Sevilla won the game 2\u20130.\n\n\n=== Previous finals ===\nIn the following table, the finals until 2009 were in the UEFA Cup era, and since 2010 in the UEFA Europa League era.\n\n\n== Venue ==\n\nThe match was the first UEFA Cup/Europa League final to be held in Budapest, and the second final in the competition's history to be held in Hungary after the 1985 first leg.\nThe final was also the third UEFA club competition final to be held in the city after the 2019 UEFA Women's Champions League final and the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, making it the fourth overall UEFA club final in Hungary. The stadium was also chosen as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020, where it hosted three group stage matches and a round of 16 fixture.\n\n\n=== Host selection ===\nThe Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na was selected as the final host by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on 2 March 2020.\nOn 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, Budapest would instead host the 2023 final.\n\n\n== Route to the final ==\n\nNote: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\n\n\n== Pre-match ==\n\n\n=== Identity ===\nThe original identity of the 2023 UEFA Europa League Final was unveiled at the group stage draw on 26 August 2022.\n\n\n=== Ambassador ===\nThe ambassador for the final was former Hungarian international Zolt\u00e1n Gera, who finished as runner-up in the 2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League with Fulham.\n\n\n=== Ticketing ===\nWith a stadium capacity of 63,000 for the final, a total amount of 46,800 tickets were available to fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 15,000 tickets each, and with the other tickets being available for sale to fans worldwide via UEFA.com from 21 to 28 April 2023 in four price categories: \u20ac150, \u20ac100, \u20ac65, and \u20ac4",

If two or more teams were equal on points upon completion of the league phase, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine their rankings:\n\nGoal difference;\nGoals scored;\nAway goals scored;\nWins;\nAway wins;\nHigher number of points obtained collectively by league phase opponents;\nSuperior collective goal difference of league phase opponents;\nHigher number of goals scored collectively by league phase opponents;\nLower disciplinary points total (direct red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points);\nUEFA club coefficient.\nDuring the league phase, criteria 1 to 5 were used to rank teams who had an equal number of points. Should any teams have been equal on points and tied on the first five criteria, they were considered equal in position and sorted alphabetically. Criteria 6 to 10 was only used to break ties upon completion of all matches.\n\n\n== Teams and seeding ==\nThe 36 teams were divided into four pots of nine teams each, with the Champions League title holders automatically placed as the top seed of pot 1. All remaining teams were allocated to pots based on their 2024 UEFA club coefficients. The participants included:\n\n29 teams which entered at this stage\n7 winners of the play-off round (5 from the Champions Path, 2 from the League Path)\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Draw ==\nThe draw for the league phase pairings was held at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 29 August 2024, 18:00 CEST. All 36 teams were manually drawn using physical balls. For every team manually drawn, a guest on stage pressed the button for the automated software to digitally draw their opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones away. Each team faced two opponents from each of the four pots, one of which they faced at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association. The draw started with Pot 1, assigning opponents to all teams, one after the other, and continued with the other pots in ascending order until all teams were assigned their opponents.\nThe switch to a primarily computer-based draw was made due to issues with the complexity and duration required by a manual draw.

A total of 24 teams competed in the knockout phase.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\n\n\n== Qualified teams ==\nThe knockout phase involved 24 teams: the 16 teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage, and the eight third-placed teams from the Europa League group stage.\n\n\n=== Europa Conference League group stage winners and runners-up ===\n\n\n=== Europa League group stage third-placed teams ===\n\n\n== Format ==\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, then 30 minutes of extra time were played (the away goals rule was not applied). If the score was still level at the end of extra time, the winners were decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if the score was level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score was still level.\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\n\nIn the draw for the knockout round play-offs, the eight group runners-up were seeded, and the eight Europa League group third-placed teams were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nIn the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight winners of the knockout round play-offs were unseeded. Again, the seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nIn the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same association could be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals were held together before the quarter-finals were played, the identity of the quarter-final winners was not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw was also held to determine which semi-final winner would be designated as the \"home\" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it was played at a neutral venue).\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nThe schedule was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\n\n\n== Bracket ==\n\n\n== Knockout round play-offs ==\nThe draw for the knockout round play-offs was held on 18 December 2023, 14:00 CET.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 15 February, and the second legs were played on 21 and 22 February 2024.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n\nSturm Graz won 5\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nServette won 1\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nUnion Saint-Gilloise won 4\u20133 on aggregate.\n\nDinamo Zagreb won 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nOlympiacos won 2\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nAjax won 4\u20133 on aggregate.\n\nMolde won 6\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nMaccabi Haifa won 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\n\n== Round of 16 ==\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 23 February 2024, 13:00 CET.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 7 March, and the second legs were played on 14 March 2024.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n\n0\u20130 on aggregate; Viktoria Plze\u0148 won 3\u20131 on penalties.\n\nAston Villa won 4\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nClub Brugge won 4\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e won 3\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nPAOK won 5\u20133 on aggregate.\n\nLille won 4\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nFiorentina won 5\u20134 on aggregate.\n\nOlympiacos won 7\u20135 on aggregate.\n\n\n== Quarter-finals ==\nThe draw for the quarter-finals was held on 15 March 2024, 14:00 CET.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe first legs were played on 11 April, and the second legs were played on 18 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\n",

Their primary goal at the start of the campaign was to qualify for next season's UEFA Champions League. At the halfway stage of the league season, the Gunners recorded their best-ever start to a Premier League campaign with 16 wins, two draws, one loss and 50 points from the first 19 games. Arsenal led the league for a long time, but ultimately their challenge collapsed, as they collected just twelve points from their final nine matches (three wins, three draws and three losses). Arteta's side finished second in the Premier League, returning to Champions League football for the first time since the 2016\u201317 season.\nArsenal were the second-youngest team in the 2022\u201323 Premier League with an average starting age of 25 years and 52 days, eleven days older than relegated Southampton, and two years and 201 days younger than champions Manchester City. Four first-team players who were aged 24 or under on 1 July 2022 \u2013 Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale and Bukayo Saka \u2013 signed new long-term contracts with the club during the campaign.\n\n\n=== Pre-season ===\nIt was reported on 3 July 2023 that some first-team players who were not in action for their respective countries since the end of the previous campaign were back to the London Colney training ground for pre-season training.\nArsenal confirmed on 6 July that English forward and academy graduate Reiss Nelson had signed a new long-term contract. On the next day the Gunners announced that French defender William Saliba had penned a new long-term contract, and would wear the number 2 shirt from the 2023\u201324 season.\nTwo days later, Arteta's side travelled to Germany for a mini training camp at Adidas headquarters in Herzogenaurach. Three academy players \u2013 Myles Lewis-Skelly, Ethan Nwaneri and Reuell Walters \u2013 were with the first-team squad. The Gunners faced 2. Bundesliga side 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg at Max-Morlock-Stadion in Nuremberg on 13 July. Saliba recovered from a back injury that had ruled him out of Arsenal's final eleven matches of the previous campaign to return to the starting line-up. Saka scored a goal on 7 minutes; but the Gunners were unable to double the lead, and an own goal from Jorginho in the second half ensured that the hosts claimed a 1\u20131 draw. The game also saw new signing and Germany international Kai Havertz make his non-competitive debut for Arsenal as a substitute at the break. They returned to England on the next day.\nOn 16 July, manager Arteta named a 29-man squad for the trip to the United States where they would play three more friendlies. The 18-year-old forward Amario Cozier-Duberry was the only academy player to travel w",

If two or more teams were equal on points upon completion of the league phase, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine their rankings:\n\nGoal difference;\nGoals scored;\nAway goals scored;\nWins;\nAway wins;\nHigher number of points obtained collectively by league phase opponents;\nSuperior collective goal difference of league phase opponents;\nHigher number of goals scored collectively by league phase opponents;\nLower disciplinary points total (direct red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points);\nUEFA club coefficient.\nDuring the league phase, criteria 1 to 5 were used to rank teams who had an equal number of points. Should any teams have been equal on points and tied on the first five criteria, they were considered equal in position and sorted alphabetically. Criteria 6 to 10 was only used to break ties upon completion of all matches.\n\n\n== Teams and seeding ==\nThe 36 teams were divided into four pots of nine teams each, with the Champions League title holders automatically placed as the top seed of pot 1. All remaining teams were allocated to pots based on their 2024 UEFA club coefficients. The participants included:\n\n29 teams which entered at this stage\n7 winners of the play-off round (5 from the Champions Path, 2 from the League Path)\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Draw ==\nThe draw for the league phase pairings was held at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 29 August 2024, 18:00 CEST. All 36 teams were manually drawn using physical balls. For every team manually drawn, a guest on stage pressed the button for the automated software to digitally draw their opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones away. Each team faced two opponents from each of the four pots, one of which they faced at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association. The draw started with Pot 1, assigning opponents to all teams, one after the other, and continued with the other pots in ascending order until all teams were assigned their opponents.\nThe switch to a primarily computer-based draw was made due to issues with the complexity and duration required by a manual draw. The draw software, developed by AE Live, guaranteed total randomness within the framew",

The top 8 teams received a bye to the round of 16, while teams finishing in positions 9 to 24 entered the knockout phase play-offs.\n\n\n== Format ==\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advances to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, then 30 minutes of extra time is played (the away goals rule is not applied). If the score is still level at the end of extra time, the winners are decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which is played as a single match, if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still level.\n\n\n=== Draw procedure ===\nIn the knockout phase, there is no country protection, with teams from the same association able to face each other in any round. Teams can also face opponents they played during the league phase.\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows:\n\nIn the draw for the knockout phase play-offs, the eight teams finishing the league phase in positions 9\u201316 were seeded, and the eight teams finishing the league phase in positions 17\u201324 were unseeded. The draw was split into four sections based on the predetermined bracket, with the seeded teams in each section drawn against one of their two possible unseeded opponents. The seeded teams host the second leg.\nIn the draw for the round of 16, the eight teams finishing the league phase in positions 1\u20138 are seeded, and the eight winners of the knockout phase play-offs are unseeded. Again, the draw is split into four sections based on the predetermined bracket, with the seeded teams in each section drawn against one of their two possible unseeded opponents. The seeded teams host the second leg.\nIn the quarter-finals and semi-finals, the exact match pairings are predetermined based on the tournament bracket. A draw is conducted only to determine which team plays the first leg at home. The winner of semi-final 1 will be designated as the \"home\" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it is played at a neutral venue).\nIn the knockout phase, teams from the same or nearby cities are not scheduled to play at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control.:\u200aArt. 24.02\u200a To avoid such scheduling conflict, several adjustments have been made: For the knockout phase play-offs and the round of 16, if the two teams are drawn to play at home for the same leg, the home match of the team that has the lower league phase ranking is moved from either Tuesday or Wednesday from a regularly scheduled time to an earlier time slot, to a different day, and/or at an alternative venue without clashing any other competition. For the quarter-finals and semi-finals, the order of legs of the tie involving the team with the lowest priority is reversed from the original draw.\n\n\n=== Predetermined pairings ===\nThe bracket structure for the knockout phase is partially fixed in advance using seeding, with a symmetrical pattern on both sides. Teams' positions in the bracket are determined by their final standings in the league phase, ensuring that higher-ranked teams face lower-ranked opponents in earlier rounds. As a result, certain sets of teams, such as the top two from the league phase, cannot meet until the final.\nThe structure of each side of the bracke",

Overall, it will be the fifth European Cup final to be held in Munich, with the 1979, 1993, and 1997 finals taking place at the Olympiastadion. Each of the previous four finals played in Munich saw a first-time winner of the competition crowned (Nottingham Forest in 1979, Marseille in 1993, Borussia Dortmund in 1997 and Chelsea in 2012). The final will also be the ninth to take place in Germany, having also taken place in Stuttgart in 1959 and 1988, Gelsenkirchen in 2004, and Berlin in 2015, equalling the record of nine European Cup finals held in Italy and Spain.

This was because Istanbul twice had the Champions League final intended for their city relocated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally planned as hosts for the 2020 final, the match was moved to Lisbon and the final hosts shifted back a year, with Istanbul instead awarded the 2021 final. However, weeks prior to the final, the 2021 fixture was moved to Porto due to travel restrictions.\nMunich, originally selected to host the 2022 final by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 24 September 2019, was later planned to host the 2023 final after the shifting of the final hosts. However, the city was awarded the 2025 final instead after being bumped from 2023 by Istanbul.\n\n\n== Pre-match ==\n\n\n=== Identity ===\nThe visual identity of the 2025 UEFA Champions League final will be unveiled at the league phase draw in Monaco on 29 August 2024.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Details ===\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) will be determined by an additional draw held after the quarter-final and semi-final draws.\n\n\n== Half-time event ==\nIt is rumored that metal rock band Linkin Park will be performing at half-time during the final.

The teams were allocated to leagues based on the 2022\u201323 UEFA Nations League overall ranking. Each team will play six matches within their group, except for teams in League D which will play four, using the home-and-away round-robin format on double matchdays in September, October and November 2024.\nOn 25 January 2023, the UEFA Executive Committee confirmed an altered format for the Nations League following the league phase. In the top division, League A, the group winners and runners-up will advance to a new quarter-final round, played home-and-away over two legs in March 2025. In each tie, group winners will face a runner-up from a different group, with the group winner hosting the second leg. The four quarter-final winners will qualify for the Nations League Finals, retaining its previous format, which is played in a knockout format, consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off and final. The semi-final pairings are determined by means of a draw. The host country for the Nations League Finals will be selected from among the four qualified teams by the UEFA Executive Committee, with the winners of the final crowned as the Nations League champions.\nTeams also compete for promotion and relegation to a higher or lower league. The group winners in Leagues B, C, and D are directly promoted, while the last-placed teams of each group in Leagues A and B are directly relegated. As League C has four groups while League D has only two, the two lowest-ranked League C teams will automatically be relegated (a change from the previous editions, which featured relegation play-outs between the fourth-placed teams of League C). As part of the format change, promotion/relegation play-offs will also be introduced, with the third-placed teams of League A facing the runners-up of League B, the third-placed teams of League B facing the runners-up of League C, and the two best-ranked fourth-placed teams of League C facing the runners-up of League D. The matches will be played home-and-away over two legs in March 2025 (League A/B and B/C) and March 2026 (League C/D), with the winners going to the higher league and the losers entering the lower league.\nIn all two-legged ties, the higher-ranked teams host the second leg. The team that scores more goals on aggregate is the winner. If the aggregate score is level, extra time is played (the away goals rule is not applied). If the score remains level after extra time, a penalty shoot-out is used to decide the winner.\n\n\n=== 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification ===\n\nThe 2024\u201325 Nations League will be partially linked with European qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with the format confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland, on 28 June 2023. The twelve group winners of FIFA World Cup qualification after the first round (group stage) will qualify directly for the World Cup. Then, the second round (play-offs) will be contested by the twelve group runners-up, along with the four best Nations League group winners, based on the Nations League overall ranking, that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. The play-offs will be split into four play-off paths, played in two single-match knockout rounds (semi-finals and finals, ",

Real Madrid also played in two European Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986).\nThis was the first Champions League final between the two clubs, and their first meeting in European competitions since the 2017\u201318 Champions League group stage encounters, when Madrid won 3\u20131 away and 3\u20132 at home. Of their previous fourteen encounters, Dortmund won three matches, Real won six matches and five finished as a draw.\nUntil the semi-finals, Borussia Dortmund had the best defence in the 2023\u201324 Champions League with six clean sheets and eight goals conceded. In contrast, Real Madrid goalkeepers had the most goal-scoring opportunities to prevent in the same season.\n\n\n=== Previous finals ===\nIn the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\n\n\n== Venue ==\nThis was the third UEFA Champions League final to take place at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, having previously been held in 2011 and 2013. Overall, it was the eighth final to be held in London, with the other five matches taking place at the original Wembley Stadium in 1963, 1968, 1971, 1978, and 1992. The match was the ninth European Cup final held in England, with the 2003 final having been held at Old Trafford in Manchester, equalling the record of nine European Cup finals held in each of Italy, Germany and Spain. It was also the thirteenth held in the United Kingdom, with the 1960, 1976 and 2002 finals held in Scotland and the 2017 final held in Wales.

League A began with the league phase in September 2024, and will culminate with the Nations League Finals in June 2025 to determine the champions of the competition.\nFor the first time, a quarter-final round will be contested in League A by the group winners and runners-up, with the winners advancing to the Nations League Finals.\nSpain are the defending champions, having won the 2023 finals.\n\n\n== Format ==\nLeague A consists of the 16 top-ranked UEFA members in the 2024\u201325 UEFA Nations League access list, split into four groups of four. Each team will play six matches within their group, using the home-and-away round-robin format on double matchdays in September, October and November 2024.\nOn 25 January 2023, the UEFA Executive Committee approved a modified format for the Nations League after the league phase, with the following changes being implemented in League A:\n\nA new quarter-final round to be played in March 2025 was introduced, thus creating continuity between the league phase ending in November 2024 and the Nations League Finals in June 2025.\nThe winners and runners-up of each group will advance to the quarter-finals, unlike previous editions where only the group winners advanced to the finals.\nThe four third-placed teams of League A will face the four runners-up of League B in the relegation play-offs, which were also introduced starting this season.\nThe last-placed teams of each group will continue to be relegated directly to League B, while the third-placed teams will compete against the runners-up of League B to determine their permanence in League A for the next season or their relegation to 2026\u201327 UEFA Nations League B. The relegation play-offs will be played home-and-away over two legs in March 2025, with the League A third-placed teams hosting the second leg.\nThe quarter-finals will also be played home and away over two legs. In each tie, group winners will face a runner-up from a different group, with the group winner hosting the second leg. The four quarter-final winners will advance to the Finals.\nThe Nations League Finals retain its previous format, which is played in a knockout format in June 2025, consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off, and final. The semi-final pairings will be determined using an open draw. The host country will be selected by the UEFA Executive Committee, preferably hosted by one of the participating teams, with the winners of the final crowned as the champions of the UEFA Nations League.\nIn all two-legged ties, the team that scores more goals on aggregate is the winner. If the aggregate score is level, extra time is played without the away goals rule. If the score remains level after extra time, a penalty shoot-out is used to decide the winner.\n\n\n== Teams ==\nThe 16 League A teams includes the top 12 teams from the 2022\u201323 League A overall ranking and four promoted teams from the 2022\u201323 League B.\n\n\n=== Team changes ===\nThe following were the team changes in League A from the 2022\u201323 season:\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina returned to League A, after a one-season absence, by securing first place in their 2022\u201323 League B group with a 1\u20130 victory over Montenegro on 23 September 2022. Israel, Scotland and Serbia reached the top flight of the UEFA Nations League for the first time, all three following similar paths, starting in League C in the inaugural edition and spending two seasons in League B before their promotion to League A.\n\n\n=== Seeding ===\nIn the 2024\u201325 access list, UEFA ranked teams based on the 2022\u201323 Nations League overall ranking, considering promotion and relegation between the leagues and the results of the 2023 UEFA Nations League Finals.

                "summary": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.\nIntroduced in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup (French: Coupe des Clubs Champions Europ\u00e9ens), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997\u201398 season. While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default, with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season. Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.\nIn its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June. The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.\nSpanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins), Italy (12 wins), Germany (8 wins), Netherlands (6 wins) and Portugal (4 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once. Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions). Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019\u201320 season. Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2\u20130 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title.",

The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.\nThe Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs. In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.

Raphinha scored a hat-trick, with Lewandowski, Kound\u00e9, Olmo and Torres scoring a goal each, while Yamal contributed with two assists to continue his impressive start to the season.\n\n\n=== September ===\nOn 15 September, Barcelona defeated Girona 4\u20131, with Yamal scoring a brace and Olmo and Pedri scoring a goal each. Lewandowski made his 100th appearance with the club.\nBarcelona started the Champions League campaign with a 2\u20131 defeat at the hands of Monaco, after Eric Garc\u00eda got sent off early on in the first half. Yamal scored the only goal for the team and his first in the Champions League and became the second youngest goalscorer of all time in the competition, only behind his teammate Ansu Fati who holds the record.\nThe team went back to winning ways after they defeated Villarreal 5\u20131 to make it six wins in as many matches in the league.

They kicked off their campaign by winning the FA Community Shield for the 17th time in their history.\nThe Gunners were the third-youngest team in the 2023\u201324 Premier League with an average starting age of 25 years and 158 days. They scored 91 goals in the Premier League, their highest-ever total in the competition. It was the most they had netted in a league campaign since 1952\u201353. Arteta's side conceded just 29 goals in the Premier League \u2013 five fewer than the second-lowest team. This was Arsenal's best defensive record for 20 years. They finished with a goal difference of +62 in the division, their highest-ever total in the competition's history. The Gunners kept 18 clean sheets (7 at home, 11 on the road) in the league, five more than the second-highest sides.\nArsenal won 28 Premier League games in the 2023\u201324 season, their highest tally in a top-flight campaign since 1970\u201371. The Gunners picked up 89 points, the second-highest total in their history. However, this was still not enough to win the Premier League title. Arteta's side ended their season as runners-up \u2013 the third-best second-placed team in the competition's history \u2013 two points behind champions Manchester City.\nAfter a six-year absence, Arsenal started their 20th UEFA Champions League campaign since the 1992\u201393 season in September 2023. They finished the group stage as winners of Group B, with the highest goal difference of any team (+12). The Gunners progressed to the quarter-final of the Champions League for the first time since 2009\u201310, ending a run of seven consecutive last-16 eliminations in the competition. Their first Champions League campaign in seven years finished in the last eight, after a 3\u20132 aggregate loss to German side Bayern Munich.\n\n\n=== Pre-season ===\nThe UEFA Euro 2024 took place in Germany from 14 June to 14 July.

Ronaldo has also finished as the top scorer for the most individual seasons in the competition's history, doing so seven times.\nThe title of highest goalscorer had previously been held by Ra\u00fal, who scored his 50th goal in 2005 while at Real Madrid to overtake Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. He held the record until November 2014, when his eventual tally of 71 was first equalled and then surpassed by Messi. Ronaldo has remained the competition's outright top scorer since September 2015; after a back-and-forth exchange of the record between him and Messi, a hat-trick by the former against Shakhtar Donetsk put Ronaldo ahead with 80 goals, and he would not relinquish the top spot again after this.\n\n",
